    <h2>We emit 51 billion tons of CO2 each year, here is the breakdown:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:30px">.</p>

    <h2>See what effect possible actions have on the pie:</h2>
   <div> <input type="checkbox" id="myCheck1" onclick="check1()"><label for="checkbox"> <b>Use of low carbon cement substitute</b> </label></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">Cement is responsible for a suprising amount of CO2 emissions.</p>

   <div> <input type="checkbox" id="myCheck2" onclick="check2()"> <b>Reduce plastic production</b> </div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">It would be very difficult to cut plastic production in half, but it would help!</p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck3" onclick="check3()">  <b>Increased ridesharing/public transport</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">Road transportation only makes up around 11% of total emissions.</p>
   <p></p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck4" onclick="check4()">  <b>Switch to  electric vehicles</b> </div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">EVs are only as green as the power that charges them. Unless we have a green grid, <br>this reduction in Road CO2 is accompanied by an increase in CO2 from power generation.</p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck5" onclick="check5()">  <b>Eliminate Coal in power generaton</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">Coal is on its way out in the developed world. But it is providing cheap and reliable power<br> 
     in developing countries. We need to make it afforadable for them to kick Coal without <br>derailing
    their development, and depriving them of afforable electricty</p>
   <div> <input type="checkbox" id="myCheck6" onclick="check6()"> <b>Eliminate Oil in power generaton</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px"> It requires massive investment in renewables to replace oil.  </p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck7" onclick="check7()">  <b>Reduce natural gas use</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px"> With many renewables the supply of energy is not reliable or inherently variable. <br> Solar doesn't produce at night, and the wind doesn't always blow! 
    Unless we can <br> store all that green power for use when we can't produce it, we need a stopgap!
    <br>That's the role of some fossel fuels until storage technology gets cheap.</p>
   <div> <input type="checkbox" id="myCheck8" onclick="check8()"> <b>Use of sustainable logging</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px">While logging may seem antiquated, suprisingly building out of wood is better for the <br>  environment 
    in many cases. Especially if it replaces high carbon CO2</p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck9" onclick="check9()">  <b>Widespread addoption of meat substitute</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px"> Meat consumption requires livestock and growth of crops for feed, all this leaves <br> a large carbon footprint. However, global reduction of meat consumption is a hard sell. <br> Many people don't want to stop eating meat, and meat is important in our diets and many 
    <br> of our cultures. There is some hope that lab grown meat could provide a green and humane <br>alternative.</p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck10" onclick="check10()"> <b>Carbon Capture</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px"> Where some emmissions seem impossible to prevent, Carbon capture presents some <br> hope of canceling them anyway. We need invent ways to make this cheap!</p>
   <div><input type="checkbox" id="myCheck9" onclick="check11()"> <b>Other Offset Methods</b></div>
   <p style="margin-left:30px"> It's impossible to exhaust the list of ideas for combatting our emissions. <br> 
    If you felt frustrated that this box doesn't do anything, go read up on carbon offsets and <br> invent some! We need awareness and innovation!</p>
